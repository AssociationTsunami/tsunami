# TODO LIST

1. Add jPlayer with a playlist on id="bottom" side of the cube.
2. Get images for each musician/artist and fix the the display so that when a user clicks on the menu image, the background image changes and we add a info box about the musician/artist with links to their website and contact details
3. figure out how to implement the paypal button so that people can pre-book and purchase tickets in advance.
4. in the future it maybe good to provide members ability to login and upload their own content.
